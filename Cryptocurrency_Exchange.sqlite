 --checking out the whole transactions table:
 SELECT * FROM transactions;
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions;

 --The money_in column records the amount (in USD) the user bought.
 --What is the total money_in in the table?
SELECT SUM(money_in)
FROM transactions;

--The money_out column records the amount (in USD) the user sold.
--What is the total money_out in the table?
SELECT SUM(money_out)
FROM transactions;

--It was reported that Bitcoin dominates Fiddy Cent’s exchange. Let’s see if it is true within these dates by answering two questions:
--How many money_in transactions are in this table?
SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions;
--How many money_in transactions are in this table where ‘BIT’ is the currency?
SELECT COUNT(money_in)
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'BIT';

--What was the largest transaction in this whole table? Was it money_in or money_out?
SELECT MAX(money_in) AS max_buy, MAX(money_out) AS max_sell
FROM transactions;

--What is the average money_in in the table for the currency Ethereum (‘ETH’)?
SELECT ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2) AS average_buy
FROM transactions
WHERE currency = 'ETH';

--Build a ledger for the different dates.
SELECT date, ROUND(AVG(money_in), 2) AS average_buy, ROUND(AVG(money_out), 2) AS average_sell
FROM transactions
GROUP BY date;
