Hacker News is a popular website run by Y Combinator. It’s widely known by people in the tech industry as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.

In this project, you will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News since its launch in 2007. It has the following columns:

title: the title of the story
user: the user who submitted the story
score: the score of the story
timestamp: the time of the story
url: the link of the story

Let’s get started!
*/

--Start by getting a feel for the hacker_news table! Let’s find the most popular Hacker News stories: What are the top five stories with the highest scores?
SELECT title, score
FROM hacker_news
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 5;

--Hacker News Moderating:

--Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users (1-9-90 Rule). Is this true of Hacker News? Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points? First, find the total score of all the stories.
SELECT SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news;

--Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories. Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores. GROUP BY and HAVING are needed!
SELECT user, score
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY score
HAVING score > 200
ORDER BY score;

SELECT user, SUM(score)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY user
HAVING SUM(score) > 200
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage. Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. So, is Hacker News dominated by these users?
SELECT (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0;

--Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are rickrolling — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video and claiming that it links to information about coding. The url of the video is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ How many times has each offending user posted this link?
SELECT user, COUNT(url)
FROM hacker_news
WHERE url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ'
GROUP BY user;

--Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites. Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most: GitHub, Medium, or New York Times? First, we want to categorize each story based on their source.
SELECT 
  CASE
    WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
    WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
    WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
    ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',

--Next, build on the previous query: Add a column for the number of stories from each URL using COUNT(). Also, GROUP BY the CASE statement. Remember that you can refer to a column in GROUP BY using a number.

COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;

--What's the best time to post a story?

--Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but… What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?
SELECT timestamp,
  strftime('%H', timestamp)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
LIMIT 20;

--SOkay, now we understand how strftime() works. Let’s write a query that returns three columns: 1-The hours of the timestamp 2-The average score for each hour 3-The count of stories for each hour
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp), 
   AVG(score),
   COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

--Let’s edit a few things in the previous query: - Round the average scores (ROUND()) - Rename the columns to make it more readable (AS). - Add a WHERE clause to filter out the NULL values in timestamp. Take a look at the result again: What are the best hours to post a story on Hacker News?
SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'Hours', 
   ROUND(AVG(score)) AS 'Average',
   COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Stories'
FROM hacker_news
WHERE timestamp IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
