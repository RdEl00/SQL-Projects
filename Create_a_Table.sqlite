/*
Create a Table
In this project, you will create your own friends table and add/delete data from it!

*/


--Create a table named friends with three columns:
CREATE TABLE friends (
  id INTEGER,
  name TEXT,
  birthday DATE
);

--Beneath your current code, add Ororo Munroe to friends. Her birthday is May 30th, 1940.
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (1, 'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30');


--Add two of your friends to the table.
INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday)
VALUES (2, 'RdEl00', '2000-06-24'), (3, 'Anna L', '1998-04-20');


--Ororo Munroe just realized that she can control the weather and decided to change her name. Her new name is “Storm”.

Update her record in friends.
UPDATE friends
SET name = 'Storm'
--WHERE name = 'Ororo Munroe'
WHERE id = 1;

--Add a new column named email.
ALTER TABLE friends
ADD COLUMN email;

--Update the email address for everyone in your table. Storm’s email is storm@codecademy.com.
UPDATE friends
SET email = ('storm@codecademy.com')
WHERE id = (1);

UPDATE friends
SET email = ('RdEl00@gmail.com')
WHERE id = (2);

UPDATE friends
SET email = ('Anna@gmail.com')
WHERE id = (3);

--Wait, Storm is fictional… Remove her from friends.
DELETE FROM friends
WHERE id = 1;

--Great job! Let’s take a look at the result one last time:
SELECT * FROM friends;
